**Have the cartographic origins of GIS (and by extension giscience) doomed it to struggling to adequately handle time and change?**

**What distinguishes contemporary approaches to 'place' from Hartshorne's regional geography?**

In the text I am (perhaps overly) kind to Hartshorne. But then I think many others have been overly unkind to him. Unfortunately he does go on a bit (OK... a _lot_) so it's perhaps easier to ignore him that take him eriously.^[Hartshorne R. 1939. The nature of geography: A critical survey of current thought in the light of the past. _Annals of the Association of American Geographers_, **39**(3/4), 173–658.]
