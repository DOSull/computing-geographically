This page attempts to show the various [spatial predicates of the 9-intersection model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM#Spatial_predicates) presented in Figure 5.1 in code.

First we make some shapes.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)
library(stringr)

# a circle
p1 <- st_point(c(-2, 0)) |> st_buffer(1, nQuadSegs = 90)
# an identical circle
p2 <- p1
# same circle shifted to the right so it is touching
p3 <- p1 + c(2, 0)
# shifted circle scaled to half size
p4 <- p3 * matrix(c(0.5, 0, 0, 0.5), 2, 2)
# and shifted down so it's touching p3 and overlapping p4 
p5 <- p4 + c(0, -0.5)
# a donut to the side
p6 <- st_difference(p3, p4) + c(2.1, 0)
# and a circle overlapping the donut
p7 <- p4 * matrix(c(1.5, 0, 0, 1.5), 2, 2) + c(2, -1)

polys <- st_sfc(list(p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7)) |> 
  st_sf() |>
  mutate(ID = as.factor(1:7), 
         dx = c(0, 0, .5, 0, 0, 0, 0), 
         dy = c(-1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0))
```

Map and label these for reference.

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
xy <- polys |> st_centroid() |>
  st_coordinates() |>
  as.data.frame() |>
  mutate(ID = polys$ID)

ggplot(polys) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = ID), colour = "white", alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("red", "dodgerblue3", "darkgreen",
               "black", "yellow", "violet", "brown")) +
  geom_label_repel(data = xy, aes(x = X, y = Y, label = ID)) +
  theme_void()
```

Now we can run various tests against the spatial predicates in turn. For example `st_disjoint` tells us the following. 

```{r}
polys |> st_disjoint()
```

We can compile the result of applying all the spatial predicates to these polygons into a table. 

The details of how this is done don't matter greatly, but if you are interested click into the code below. The core of it is based on the various `st_*` functions such as `st_intersects` or `st_contains`. These correspond, more or less to the relations identified in Figure 5.1. The spatial predicates available in the `sf` package in _R_ correspond to those implemented in spatial databases such as [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/).

```{r}
#| code-fold: true

get_spatial_query_as_vector <- function(data, predicate) {
  data |> 
    predicate() |>
    lapply(str_c, collapse = " ") |>
    unlist()
}

de9im <- data.frame(
  ID = polys$ID,
  disjoint          = get_spatial_query_as_vector(polys, st_disjoint),
  touches           = get_spatial_query_as_vector(polys, st_touches),
  equals            = get_spatial_query_as_vector(polys, st_equals),
  intersects        = get_spatial_query_as_vector(polys, st_intersects),
  contains_properly = get_spatial_query_as_vector(polys, st_contains_properly),
  contains          = get_spatial_query_as_vector(polys, st_contains),
  within            = get_spatial_query_as_vector(polys, st_within),
  covers            = get_spatial_query_as_vector(polys, st_covers),
  covered_by        = get_spatial_query_as_vector(polys, st_covered_by)
)

knitr::kable(de9im)
