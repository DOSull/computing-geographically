It's not about time, it's about _becoming_...

<hr>

**So do these kinds of dynamic models&mdash;cellular automata and ABMs&mdash;_really_ address the process problem?**

I've personally invested a lot of time and effort in making cellular automaton and agent-based models, and even I'm not entirely convinced. Why might we be skeptical of a claim that they capture 'process'.

<hr>

**If not CA and ABMs, then what?**

Can we do better? What about the much-vaunted digital twins? What failing do any of these representations share?

<hr>

**Setting aside for now what they might look like, in what ways might more process-oriented platforms be useful?**

What kinds of things is GIS bad at that more process-oriented approaches would be better at?
