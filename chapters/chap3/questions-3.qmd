Is scale all in our heads?

<hr>

**Have you come across any studies that range across the 10 to 15 orders of magnitude referenced on pages 46-47?**

What topics might demand consideration of such a wide range of scales? And what would the challenges be of studying such topics? How does working with scale hierarchies in this context help?

<hr>

**All things considered, does it really only make sense to think of scale as socially constructed?**
Does scale really exist independent of human observation? Note that this is also an inference we might draw from the giscience perspectives on scale presented by Montello^[Montello DR. 1993. [Scale and multiple psychologies of space](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-57207-4_21). In AU Frank and I Campari (eds) *Spatial Information Theory: A Theoretical Basis for GIS*, pages 312-321. Lecture
Notes in Computer Science 716. Springer.] and Couclelis^[Couclelis H. 1992. [People manipulate objects (but cultivate fields): Beyond the raster-vector debate in GIS](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-55966-3_3). In AU Frank, I Campari, and U Formentini (eds) *Theories and Methods of Spatio-Temporal Reasoning in Geographic Space*, pages 65–77. Lecture Notes in Computer Science 639. Springer.], discussed on pages 57-60.

**Would geography be better off 'without scale'?**
Some of the leading protagonists in the 'scale debates' of the 1990s, eventually argued for an abandonment of the concept of scale.^[Marston SA, JP Jones III, and K Woodward. 2005. Human geography without scale. *Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers* **30**(4) 416–432.] What would be the implications of such a move?

<hr>

**Zoomable web-maps are maps without scale. Discuss!**
Also for discussion: explicitly relating scale and map projection in the way it is done in this chapter might strike some as a bit of a reach. What do you think?

<hr>

**Is map generalization just 'lying with maps'?**
Mark Monmonier suggests in _How to Lie with Maps_ that cartographica generalisation is unavoidable and inevitably makes maps misleading.^[Monmonier MS. 2018. [*How to Lie with Maps*](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/H/bo27400568.html). 3rd edition. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.] Is lying an appropriate framework for thinking about map generalisation?
