If you download and run it locally, you’ll find some commented out code at the end that implements a save-history procedure that means you can run the model for a bit then get a CSV file with who, x, y, and t output for the flockers, which is the basis for the cover art. who is NetLogo’s endearing default variable name that we would more often think of as ‘ID’ or similar. It’s because the moving things in NetLogo are turtles, not mere simple locations. This puts me in mind of Gillian Rose and Torsten Hägerstrand’s thoughts on the living bodies at the tips of space-time paths, as discussed in §Limits to Time Geography in Chapter 7."

The opening section on modern forestry instantly makes sense and gives the gist of the argument very quickly. It’s certainly possible to disagree with the idea that all attempts at centralisation are doomed to fail2 as they erase local knowledge, flatten out difference missing key details, oversimplify, and land us in all kinds of trouble via unintended consequences. Saying that, it’s hard to think of any scientific or technical advance that hasn’t led us at least some of the way down this well trodden path. It’s hard here not to pick up an echo of Whithead’s “Fallacy of Misplaced Concreteness” (yup… he capitalised it) which is discussed in the context of process philosophies in my Chapter 8.\nBut never mind all that: what about that title?! For a long time, I wanted to somehow make the title Seeing Like a Geographer work for my book, and Seeing Geographically was also in the running. Sadly, neither was a good fit for what the book actually became. I did once manage to crowbar the ‘Seeing…’ trope into the title of a graduate seminar, ‘Seeing Geographically’, which as is noted in the preface was an important jumping off point for the book. The subtitle of Scott’s book is also pretty great: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed. I wouldn’t go so far as to declare GIS ‘failed’, but I do think that as a platform it works hard to make us see the world in particular ways, and that we would do better to take a step back and allow ourselves to think (and see) geographically using computers in a wider variety of ways.\nWhich brings me to…"

    "text": "Tools to think with\nThis one is only a title, and a misremembered one at that. The title of Waddington’s book was Tools for Thought3, which I’ve never actually read, but reading this blog post, I probably should: it sounds great! I also note from its table of contents an early section entitled ‘Things and Processes’ (again, see my Chapter 8).\nFor present purposes, more important than the content of Waddington’s book is my misremembrance of its title, which lodged in my brain as ‘tools to think with’. That’s a sufficiently generic phrase that I might also have encountered it somewhere else. Anyway… for me it’s how I’ve come to think about computers: as tools to think with. The whole tool/theory/thought thing doesn’t need rehearsing here. It is central to one of the more depressing exchanges about GIS in all of the geography literature,4 which seems in retrospect to have closed down the early 90s rapprochment between ‘GISers’ and geography more widely, as Dawn Wright, Mike Goodchild, and Jim Proctor’s well-intentioned attempt to open up a conversation about GIS as ‘tool or science?’ was treated rather dismissively by John Pickles.5\nAnyway, ‘tools to think with’ is central to my argument that the geographical representations we adopt when the computer we turn to is a GIS are limiting and potentially unhelpful. When we ‘do GIS’ we take up those representations unthinkingly, and the computer has already done a a lot of the important thinking for us. So, for example, When we emphasise to students the importance of transforming all the data layers in a project into the same coordinate reference system, we’ve already assumed away many of the most interesting geographical questions we might ask!\nWhat then would it mean to instead think geographically with computers?"

    "section": "From thinking geographically to Computing Geographically",
    "text": "From thinking geographically to Computing Geographically\nThis is where Peter Jackson’s short paper ‘Thinking geographically’6 came in. My bibliographic database tells me I downloaded it in August 2013, which checks out. I was thinking then about what an ‘intro GIS/geospatial’ class ought to look like on a campus (Berkeley) where excellent courses already occupied that space as part of a GIS minor.\nI came to two conclusions. First, such a class in 2013 (and a decade on the point is even clearer) should not be about GIS at all, but about web-based ‘geospatial stuff’.7 Second, it seemed to me then—and still does now—that such a course should start from how geographers think about the world, and how those ideas manifest (or perhaps don’t) in geospatial tools. This could provide a basis for more thoughtful approaches to ‘doing GIS’ (see Chapter 9).\nFrom the idea of an intro geospatial course centred around geographical thinking it’s a very short internet search to Jackson’s ‘Thinking geographically’. Crucially (for the course and for the book) he asks\n\nBut what concepts and theories would you choose as constituting the heart of our subject, contributing uniquely to our understanding of the world? (page 199)\n\nJackson’s answer is a lot shorter than mine, but then his paper is 6 pages and the book is 300! The course that I developed ‘Digital Worlds’,8 also covers less ground than the book, although if I were still teaching it, I’d most certainly use the book for readings. For the record, Jackson’s key concepts (three of them pairs) are space and place, scale and connection, proximity and distance, and relational thinking. On reflection, it’s a little odd that ‘distance’ per se didn’t make it into Computing Geographically, but all the others are represented, and of course distance and proximity are implied.\nNeedless to say, arriving at the final list of concepts covered in the book was an iterative process. Space, place and scale were clearly never not going to make the cut. Some other concepts came and went, depending on how accessible, generalisable, and widely deployed they seem to me to be. The extent to which they have been, or could potentially be engaged in giscience, was also important as a book attempting to ‘bridge’ giscience and geography needs both sides to come to the party for the coverage to be useful and meaningful."

I hope it’s clear there is a whole lot more to my book than a response to Peter Jackson’s well-posed question quoted above. While books emerge in their writing, the writing itself isn’t where they begin. There is a pre-history of thought and ideas before any words are committed to the computer screen. ‘Thinking geographically’, along with Seeing Like a State, and the non-existent Tools to Think With (I’d read that book!), are part of the pre-history of _Computing Geographically, which I am pleased to be able to acknowledge here.\nThis rather meandering post gives some sense (I hope) of how books happen—at least for me. After all, if the path from the general idea to the finished article was more linear, it wouldn’t be as hard, nor take as long, to write them (see also Rosa, support cat)."

In this book, I approach them the other way around, starting with process, recognising that if the world really is anything, it’s processes all the way down, not things at all. This involves engaging some process philosophy, which is a wild ride! Recognising pattern offers us a way into that world.\nComplexity science may be one way for giscience to grapple with these ontological challenges, and it (i.e. complexity science) is where I started my geographical journey, and what drew me into the PhD program at UCL’s CASA to work with Mike Batty.

It would open on a couple of my intellectual heroes from early in geography’s quantitative revolution, showing how their work was deeply engaged with geography, and contrast that with how distanced from geography giscience and GIS have become. Then, somehow or other I was going to explain how this distance had grown.\n\nWhat happened? Do any of the capsule explanations that follow this quote seem more plausible than the others?

The code for making geometries in R is ugly, so I’ve hidden it.\n\n\nCode\nmake_square &lt;- function(x = 0, y = 0, d = 1) {\n  xs &lt;- x + c(-1, 1, 1, -1) * d / 2\n  ys &lt;- y + c(-1, -1, 1, 1) * d / 2\n  xs &lt;- c(xs, xs[1])\n  ys &lt;- c(ys, ys[1])\n  st_polygon(list(matrix(c(xs, ys), ncol = 2)))\n}\n\ngrid &lt;- expand_grid(x = 1:10, y = 1:10) |&gt; as_tibble()\n\npolys &lt;- list()\nfor (r in 1:nrow(grid)) {\n  polys &lt;- c(polys, make_square(x = grid$x[r], y = grid$y[r]))\n}\n\npoly_sf &lt;- polys |&gt; \n  lapply(list) |&gt;\n  lapply(st_polygon) |&gt;\n  st_sfc() |&gt;\n  st_sf(x = grid[, 1], y = grid[, 2])\n\npoly_sf$z &lt;- poly_sf$x + runif(nrow(poly_sf), -0.5, 0.5)\n\n\nAnyway… we have a 10 by 10 grid of squares with values that increase from left to right:\n\n\nCode\nbrks &lt;- .5 + (0:100) / 10\n\nggplot(poly_sf) + \n  geom_sf(aes(fill = z)) + \n  scale_fill_distiller(palette = \"Spectral\") +\n  guides(fill = \"none\") + \n  theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we aggregate into columns and rows, taking the mean value of our variable in each case, and then assembling them into a single dataset with a variable aggregation which we can use to ‘facet’ the results in to two maps.\n\n\nCode\ncolumn_sf &lt;- poly_sf |&gt;\n  group_by(x) |&gt;\n  summarise(z = mean(z)) |&gt;\n  mutate(aggregation = \"by column\")\n\nrow_sf &lt;- poly_sf |&gt;\n  group_by(y) |&gt;\n  summarise(z = mean(z)) |&gt;\n  mutate(aggregation = \"by row\")\n\naggregated_data &lt;- bind_rows(column_sf, row_sf)\n\n\nAnd now we can make maps of the results. The column-wise aggregation emphasizes the gradient, while the row-wise aggregation erases it completely, since every row has a similar set of values ranging from low to high, and when these are combined each row ends up pretty much the same.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(aggregated_data) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = z)) + \n  scale_fill_distiller(palette = \"Spectral\") +\n  guides(fill = \"none\") + \n  facet_wrap( ~ aggregation) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(strip.text = element_text(size = 14, margin = margin(2, 0, 2, 0, \"pt\")))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# License (MIT)\n#\n# Copyright (c) 2023 David O'Sullivan\n#\n# Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\n# obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\n# files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction,\n# including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge,\n# publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software,\n# and to  permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\n# subject to the following conditions:\n#\n# The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\n# in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n#\n# THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\n# OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n# FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The core of it is based on the various st_* functions such as st_intersects or st_contains. These correspond, more or less to the relations identified in Figure 5.1.

And what would the challenges be of studying such topics? How does working with scale hierarchies in this context help?\nAll things considered, does it really only make sense to think of scale as socially constructed? Does scale really exist independent of human observation? Note that this is also an inference we might draw from the giscience perspectives on scale presented by Montello1 and Couclelis2, discussed on pages 57-60.\nWould geography be better off ‘without scale’? Some of the leading protagonists in the ‘scale debates’ of the 1990s, eventually argued for an abandonment of the concept of scale.3 What would be the implications of such a move?\nZoomable web-maps are maps without scale. Discuss! Also for discussion: explicitly relating scale and map projection in the way it is done in this chapter might strike some as a bit of a reach. What do you think?\nIs map generalization just ‘lying with maps’? Mark Monmonier suggests in How to Lie with Maps that cartographica generalisation is unavoidable and inevitably makes maps misleading.4 Is lying an appropriate framework for thinking about map generalisation?\n© 2023-24 David O’Sullivan"

    "section": "Make a map",
    "text": "Make a map\nOK, with that done, we can make a map. The degree of difficulty is much increased by choosing a Briesemeister projection. We choose projections like this one not because they are easy, but because they are hard (something like that…). Anyway the published map is actually an oblique Hammer-Aitoff projection, and not the right kind of oblique projection to be a Briesemeister…\nRecently, I unearthed a proj string at Michael Minn’s website, in the R code for this page that produces the Briesemeister projection. (However… I suspect that code is no longer entirely valid as the +M parameter included in that string no longer seems to have any effect on the output and the linked proj manual is v4.3, which is a long way out of date.)\nAnyway, here’s the string we are using—but even this is not the full story as we will see later.\n\n\nCode\nbries &lt;- \"+proj=ob_tran +o_proj=hammer +o_lon_p=0 +o_lat_p=45 +lon_0=10\"\n\n\n\nDealing with that weird projection\nA world ‘disc’ for the background. Make this by buffering a point and stretching it to an ellipse with the Hammer projection extent.\n\n\nCode\ndisc &lt;- st_point(c(0, 0)) |&gt;\n  st_buffer(1, nQuadSegs = 90)\ndisc &lt;- disc * matrix(c(18040096, 0, 0, 9020048), 2, 2)\ndisc &lt;- disc |&gt;\n  st_sfc() |&gt;\n  data.frame() |&gt;\n  st_sf(crs = bries)\n\n\nThe world countries must be cut at the Briesemeister ‘cut line’ which is where there is a break in the projection, to avoid anomalies when places are projected that cross the line. We figured out where this line is in other work…\n\n\nCode\ndata(\"World\")\n\ncut_line &lt;- st_read(\"briesemeister-cut-corrected.geojson\") |&gt;\n  st_buffer(1000) # metres!\n\n\nReading layer `briesemeister-cut-corrected' from data source \n  `/Users/david/Documents/code/computing-geographically/chapters/chap4/briesemeister-cut-corrected.geojson' \n  using driver `GeoJSON'\nSimple feature collection with 1 feature and 0 fields\nGeometry type: LINESTRING\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -170 ymin: -89.99058 xmax: 10 ymax: 44.21063\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n\nCode\nworld &lt;- World |&gt;\n  st_difference(cut_line) |&gt;\n  st_transform(bries)\n\n\n\n\nMake a graticule\nA graticule - here we assemble this as linestrings (with many points) because projection of tm_graticules output can be problematic, especially if the projection has cuts other than at ±180° longitude (and even then it can have issues), or as in this case is in any way unusual.\n\n\nCode\nget_meridian &lt;- function(longitude) {\n  st_linestring(matrix(cbind(longitude, seq(-90, 90, 1)),\n                       ncol = 2, byrow = FALSE)) |&gt;\n    st_sfc(crs = 4326)\n}\n\nget_meridians &lt;- function(spacing = 10) {\n  g &lt;- c()\n  for (lon in seq(-180, 180 - spacing, spacing)) {\n    g &lt;- c(g, get_meridian(longitude = lon))\n  }\n  g\n}\n\nget_parallel &lt;- function(latitude) {\n  st_linestring(matrix(cbind(seq(-180, 180, 1), latitude),\n                       ncol = 2, byrow = FALSE)) |&gt;\n    st_sfc(crs = 4326)\n}\n\nget_parallels &lt;- function(spacing = 10) {\n  g &lt;- c()\n  for (lat in seq(-90 + spacing, 90 - spacing, spacing)) {\n    g &lt;- c(g, get_parallel(latitude = lat))\n  }\n  g\n}\n\ngraticule &lt;- c(get_meridians(), get_parallels()) |&gt;\n  st_sfc(crs = 4326) |&gt;\n  # again it must be cut at the Briesemeister breakline\n  st_difference(cut_line) |&gt;\n  st_sfc() |&gt;\n  data.frame() |&gt; \n  st_sf() |&gt;\n  st_transform(bries)\n\n\n\n\nAs it turns out\nAs noted, the published map is differently projected that the one we are making here. To get to the Briesemeister proper we have to stretch our oblique Hammer-Aitoff projection. See\n\nBriesemeister W. 1953. A new oblique equal-area projection. Geographical Review 43(2) 260–261. doi: 10.2307/211940.\n\nfor details. So let’s also do that here (this really is bonus material). We could use the +proj=affine transformation with appropriate settings, but I’ve had issues getting GDAL and tmap to cooperate with pipeline projected data. Instead, we’ll just use the weird matrix post-multiplication of geometries trick that sf allows to apply the required stretch. Unfortunately this does not update the CRS information, making these data layers useless for almost any other purpose.\n\n\nCode\nstretch_mat &lt;- matrix(c(sqrt(7/8), 0, 0, sqrt(8/7)), 2, 2)\ndisc &lt;- disc |&gt;\n  mutate(geometry = geometry * stretch_mat)\nworld &lt;- world |&gt;\n  mutate(geometry = geometry * stretch_mat)\ngraticule &lt;- graticule |&gt;\n  mutate(geometry = geometry * stretch_mat)\n\n# and not forgetting the Springfields...\nspringfields &lt;- st_read(\"all-results-Springfield.geojson\") |&gt;\n  st_transform(bries) |&gt;\n  mutate(geometry = geometry * stretch_mat)\n\n\nFor what it’s worth, all these shenanigans are a good example of why more flexibility in the projection architectures of contemporary platforms would be welcome, something discussed in Chapter 3."

    "text": "The cartograms in Figure 2.2 were made using ScapeToad (linked here). They are examples of Gastner-Newman cartograms, popularised by Danny Dorling at the World Mapper website. I’m not really in love with this style of cartogram, although I do appreciate the impact they’ve had in making the notion of cartograms more widely known. Furthermore, there aren’t many other cartogram styles that have been automated even to the limited extent that this one has.\nThe broader point, made several times in the book is the arbitrary nature of the preference for geodetic accuracy in map projections.It would be preferable if standard geospatial platforms could support any mapping of geocentric (latitude-longitude) coordinates to other two dimensional coordinate systems, as defined by end-users. For more on this, see\nIn fact, the machinery to do so exists in most GIS in the tools used to georeference imagery. However, these tools typically only enable warping inputs so that they conform with already known coordinate reference systems, although the underlying mathematics of mapping points between two coordinate systems could in principle allow user-defined coordinates, with potential benefits for the exploration of multiple geographies.\nAn example of this is shown below, again an Aotearoa New Zealand population cartogram.\nHowever, this example was produced in an unusual way. I first used ScapeToad to make a population-based cartogram, but at the same time transformed a set of hex-grid points. This gives me a set of mappings of coordinate pairs in a geodetic coordinate space (in this case New Zealand Transverse Mercator NZTM), and the corresponding coordinate locations in ‘population cartogram space’. Using these it is possible to interpolate any points in NZTM coordinates into the cartogram coordinate space. The mapping is the same information that is provided by ScapeToad’s transformation grid (pictured in Figure 2.3 in the book), but with more detail.\n© 2023-24 David O’Sullivan"

The original coast outline is in blue, the transformed coast points in red.\n\n\nCode\nnz_coast_carto &lt;- tibble(x = nz_coast_carto_x, \n                         y = nz_coast_carto_y) |&gt;\n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"x\", \"y\"), crs = 2193)\n\nggplot(nz) +\n  geom_sf(colour = \"blue\", fill = \"#00000000\") +\n  geom_sf(data = nz_coast_carto, colour = \"red\", size = 0.0001) +\n  theme_void()"

    "text": "Embedding this in GIS\nClearly the above example is not entirely satisfactory. It can only transform points and a lot of additional code would be required to add that capability. In principle however, it is not difficult to include this capability in GIS or other standard platforms, using capabilities already present in the proj tools for coordinate transformation that underpin today’s geospatial software. This is something Luke Bergmann and I have been exploring for a while.\nSpecifically proj‘s tinshift transformation provides for exactly the transformation carried out above. It requires a JSON file with the triangulation information precomputed. That’s how I made the example at the top of this page. With a ’tinshift’ JSON file, the following GDAL command line will carry out the required transformation between NZTM and a population cartogram based on 2018 census data:\nogr2ogr -skipfailures -ct \"+proj=pipeline +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1 +step +proj=tinshift +file=tinshift.json +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1\" &lt;output GPKG&gt; &lt;input GPKG&gt;\nUnfortunately, for reasons we don’t fully understand the additional axisswap transformation is required, either side of the tinshift operation requiring a projection ‘pipeline’ to be used. The -skipfailures option prevents the command failing completely if a polygon becomes invalid as a result of the transformation.\nHere’s a JSON file for the New Zealand population cartogram, if you want to try it for yourself.\nThis might not be the most elegant way to project any geospatial data into a cartogram space, but it is already available in existing tools!\n\n\nCode\n# License (MIT)\n#\n# Copyright (c) 2023 David O'Sullivan\n#\n# Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\n# obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\n# files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction,\n# including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge,\n# publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software,\n# and to  permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\n# subject to the following conditions:\n#\n# The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\n# in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n#\n# THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\n# OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n# FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This chapter considers geographical theories about space and how space is—and potentially could be—represented in giscience.

This allows us to aggregate observations that are broadly similar or broadly different.\n\n\nCode\nget_correlated_df &lt;- function(cor = 0.5) {\n  # generate a multivariate normal distribution\n  # mu is the mean centre, Sigma is the covariance matrix\n  mvrnorm(n = 1024, mu = c(5, 5), \n          Sigma = matrix(c(1, cor, cor, 1), 2, 2)) |&gt;\n    as.data.frame() |&gt;\n    rename(x = V1, y = V2) |&gt;\n    arrange(x + y) |&gt; \n    mutate(id = row_number())\n}\n\n\n\n\nAggregator functions\nNext two functions that aggregate either similar or different observations. This is a fairly crude approach but it works. agg_similar() uses integer division to create a ‘grouper’ variable that goes eight 0s, then eight 1s, then eight 2s, and so on up to eight 127s. When group_by is applied using this variable, sets of 8 similar observations are aggregated and the mean taken to give a new dataset.\nConversely, if the grouper variable is based on the remainder from division by 128, we get 8 sequences of 0, 1, 2, 3,… 127, and when these are aggregated into groups, each will consist of eight observations at widely separated positions in the sequence (i.e., with very different values).\n\n\nCode\n# aggregate similar observations\nagg_similar &lt;- function(df) {\n  df |&gt;\n    mutate(grouper = id %/% 8) |&gt;\n    group_by(grouper) |&gt;\n    summarise(x = mean(x), \n              y = mean(y)) |&gt;\n    dplyr::select(-grouper) |&gt;\n    ungroup()\n}\n\n# aggregate different observations\nagg_different &lt;- function(df) {\n  df |&gt;\n    mutate(grouper = id %% 128) |&gt;\n    group_by(grouper) |&gt;\n    summarise(x = mean(x), \n              y = mean(y)) |&gt;\n    dplyr::select(-grouper) |&gt;\n    ungroup()\n}"

There may be better tools available for cleaning up network data attributes.\nWe assume a default_speed of 30 km/h expressed in metres per minute (i.e. 500!). Where we find maximum speed information in the data we use that instead.\nWe assume a delay at intersections—this might not make total sense, but slows things down on major arterials.\nspeed_units_per_metre is the maxspeed attribute from OSM and for most jurisdictions is km, so 0.001 per metre.\n\n\nCode\ndefault_speed = 30 * 1000 / 60 # default driving speed in m / min\nintersection_delay = .33 # wait time at intersection in minutes\nunits_per_metre = 0.001\n\n\nSome hackery below to convert appropriately if maxspeed is missing or is a list of some kind or is expressed in mph.\n\n\nCode\n# add an edge attribute for time in minutes required to traverse each edge\nfor data in G.edges.values():\n    len_seg = data[\"length\"]\n    data[\"time\"] = len_seg / default_speed\n    if \"maxspeed\" in data:\n        max_speed = data[\"maxspeed\"]\n        if type(max_speed) is list:\n            max_speed = max_speed[0]\n        if \";\" in max_speed:\n            max_speed = max_speed.split(\";\")[0]\n        if \"mph\" in max_speed:\n            max_speed = max_speed.split()[0]\n            units_per_metre = 0.0006213712\n        if max_speed.isnumeric():\n            max_speed = float(max_speed)\n        data[\"time\"] = len_seg * units_per_metre / max_speed * 60\n    data[\"time\"] += intersection_delay\n\n\n\nCalculate node distances from centre node\nNow we can determine network travel times from our centre node to every other node.

    "text": "Words are what we make of them\nEarly in the writing of the book, by which I mean as far back as 2018, the ‘word’ GIScience with its excess of upper case letters started to bother me. It looks odd (to me anyway) on the page, and also strangely exceptional. There are not many words like that in this or any other book (GISer is an exception, about which more below). In any case, it felt strange to me to use this oddly commercial construction, familiar from the tech world, for a subdiscipline in geography.\nAnd I was going to be using the word, or whatever that collection of letters is, a lot, so if it bothered me, I had to find a solution.\nOne option was simply not to abbreviate geographical information science—or is it geographic information science? That might be the correct answer. But oh my! It would likely add a couple of pages to the book to no great purpose, and it’s such a mouthful!\nTentatively (and somewhat reluctantly), I experimented with treating giscience as a normal word, and after a while it looked right to me, and I even started to like it. I decided to stick with that choice and I am happy with it. If it bothers some people, I think that’s their problem not mine. Language changes and evolves all the time. In this instance, I am being intentional about my part in that change. I note that GIScience at the time of writing (late 2023), unlike GIS, has yet to make it into the Oxford English Dictionary. That, at the very least, leaves things up for grabs, when it comes to ‘correct’ usage.\nThere is a slightly tongue-in-cheek footnote on the very first page proper (after a footnote about GIS) discussing some of this, and even suggesting that we pronounce giscience to rhyme with omniscience. If it’s not obvious, I don’t expect anybody to do this. I also really don’t care if readers mentally edit giscience to read GIScience (does the latter involve inner YELLING?) or if they expand the contraction to geographic(al) information science every time they see it in print.\nAnd of course, it’s not up to me how readers read the book (§How to Read the Book notwithstanding), or how they go on from there. Capitalise that word as you see fit! Giscience works for me.\n\nOn geographic(al) information science\nA significant motive for the geographical information science coinage was a quest for academic respectability1 following the funding by the US National Science Foundation of the National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis. This made all kinds of sense at the time. I remember as a PhD student hearing the argument pithily summarised with the phrase (attributed perhaps apocryphally to Stan Openshaw), “there aren’t any Excel conferences, so why would they be GIS ones?” Well quite. Stan was an advocate for geocomputation and that’s a label that I would be happier with, although its usefulness is a bit accidental, depending as it does on the the brevity of the ‘geo-’ prefix as Helen Couclelis has pointed out.2\nSince that coinage ‘geographical information science’ has often been associated with a boundary policing anxiety to distinguish geographical information science (a real science) from geographical information systems (just people using a particular software platform). I understand the distinction people are attempting to make when they insist on the difference, but it is a distinction that is ambiguous at best, incoherent at worst, and often simply impossible to make. As a long-time associate editor at International Journal of Geographical Information Science, one time co-editor of Transactions in GIS, frequent member of the Program Committee of the GIScience conference series, and erstwhile Professor of Geography and uh… Geographic(al) Information Geospatial Science, I have rarely found the distinction useful.\nThe other problem with geographical information science (for me at least) is that it attaches giscience too closely to computer science and information science. That might be a more comfortable home for some. Geoinformatics departments and schools seem particularly common in Europe, and that’s great: a lot of good work is done in those settings, and some of it shows up throughout the book. The problem with being close to computer science is being absorbed into that much larger, and, let’s face it, for the most part more technically accomplished community, and losing sight of the geographical aspects of giscience. A central concern of Computing Geographically is that giscience should not lose that connection.\n\n\nOn GISers\nBut, I hear you ask, what about GISer? Well yeah… about that. I really like the term GISer. And for whatever reason, probably its lack of pretense, it doesn’t bother me like GIScience does. Anyone who engages geography using computers and georeferenced data can be a GISer. There is no requirement to be advancing some nebulous science of how to do geographical computing implied in being a GISer. GISer is somehow democratic and inclusive, where giscience (however it is capitalised) is not.\nWhat can I say? My book, my rules!"

Geocomputation for all its virtues is altogether too computational, and as the book argues at some length, giscience is geography anyway!"
